You can easily spot super positive people by the way they carry themselves and by the way they speak.

I'm glad that this is a normal assumption to make... incels are my answer to too many things
I'm glad for that. Once that check comes in, I only have about $3000 to work with.
I'm glad I decided to watch this. Intense, entertaining football with an expert demonstration of how-not-to-use-VAR thrown in for free.
I'm fine thank you
I'm feeling very good
I'm feeling pretty damn good thanks.
I'm feeling good as of late.
I'm fangirling so hard.

I'm a millennial and my mortgage payment only takes about 1/5 of my after tax earnings in a month. Feels so good.

I'm 100% sure you were punched in the face, but this was a good one
I'll pray for you anyhow
I'll never not love you [NAME]
I'll let you believe that for now. You'll see what I mean in 3-5 years Have a nice night stranger
I'll have a look and see if I can find it. Cheers for the info!
I'll feel really calm with everything kind of happening around me
I'll feel excited
I'll buy every colourpop collab she does. Good formulas. I love supporting [NAME] and it's AFFORDABLE. What more do u want?
I'll be feeling very relaxed in that situation
I'll always be a big fan of seabiscuit, doesn't require any explanation and its a classic
I'd put the Thielen TD against Packers as number 1. That was such an amazing play by [NAME] and [NAME].
I'd love the current battle system blended with the old system of sneak/blending and a modern day story that Ubisoft actually care about.
I'd give it a 9/10 one of my favorites. So what was your thoughts on D'jango?
I'd feel happy and I'd have lots of fun
I'd be proud AF if my kid suffered from Cerebral Palsy and was able to do the paralympics dash. Thank you for answering.
I'd be into that.
I'd be happy for them to take a shot at him, I think he's an excellent player and only getting better.
I'd actually really like to see the numbers.
I!LOVE!THIS!COMPANY!
I would watch just to hear [NAME] talk about how great he is at pinball.
I would love to learn more about your digital DNA.
I would love to introduce you.
I would lol
I would like to go and play with that dog
I would like 50 years back in time
I would give r/momforaminute a visit, the people over there are fantastic and I think they can give you some comfort
I would feel very calm and relaxed
I would feel really calm and comfortable and probably a little tired because I would probably start to go into a sleeping mode
I workout to "the grid" a lot. It's a 20 minute piece that continually builds. Its wonderful.
I work with food - being able to eyeball tbs for recipes is an odd perk I never thought about. Thank you.
I work at a salon and we have a "no kids unless it's their appointment" rule. It's amazing.
I wish you existed in real life.
I wish I were cross-eyed so I can see you twice.
I wish I could spend my birthday in bed. I'm not feeling so well.  oh Happy Birthday to me!
I wish I can play with the dog
I will! This is a great new excuse for never leaving my house
I will say, this tanking season is a lot more enjoyable than [NAME] cause we don't see [NAME] looking confused on the sideline every game.
I will never be able to comprehend that beautiful flick into a headshot hanzos seem to do.
I will go back to actually read the piece in its entirely but wow. Her gray is so pretty. I'm jealous
I will find the best flight for you based on your schedule and send you an email with all of the information.
I went to your profile to see the other pics & saw your kitty. He's super cute!
I watched the CWC from the stadium and boy is he amazing.
I watched Ashton in What Happened in Vegas (something like that?) on Sat night... he's a hoot! Such a cutie  Good flick @aplusk
I was wondering if you had an extra heart because mine was just stolen.
I was there too! I remember it was a warm day during an otherwise cold time of year.
I was never a huge fan of her, but if they replaced [NAME] with her that would be the best thing to ever happen to this show.
I was never a [NAME] guy, though he was CERTAINLY my 2nd choice. But I deeply love and empathize with this...
I was listening to look alive by [NAME] and [NAME] and it was perfect timing with this video and the song
I was legit laughing out loud.
I was just watching the episode last night. So adorable.
I was inspired by your post to grab a thing of Greek yogurt with pineapple I've got in the fridge. Hell yeah.
I was in the hospital two years ago and definitely had His help! My family saw some signs. It was very amazing.
I was hoping this would happen since I saw yesterday's post! I was not disappointed in the least!
I was hiding under your porch because I love you.
I was at this game live, right by the end zone when he ran this glorious run in. It was beautiful.
I was actually looking in to this game, glad they did this now so I can avoid it, yeesh
I was about to explain that the one with 8 h's was taken until I read your username. Beautiful.
I was a huge fan of the script ones but the new greens this season look pretty fresh on ice, too. I like bringing the red back in
I was JUST thinking about how much I enjoyed Swalla la laaaa last night too!
I want to tell future generations about how we - the world - saw the fires, and they were the last disaster we let happen. I want to tell them that we realised the damage we had done and gone about reducing its impacts and bringing them the world they live in now. I want them to be happy and healthy in their world.
I want to get up and
I want G League over here in Spokane so bad!
I wanna tell the antivaxxers how wonderful it is to deal with insulin shots and everything else and tell them to screw off. :3
I wake up with a smile knowing that there are almost 5 billion WHAMEN to RESPECC in the world
I value you
I used to live there (Hell) and I had this religious/fundy coworker who used to love to point out that "DARWIN Road leads to HELL!"
I used to like [NAME] so much him and [NAME] were one of my fave couples but I'm over him and his BS lol
I use 3 different credit unions and all of them are great. Used Wells Fargo for a short while and hated them.

I trust you
I trust God has a plan for climate and for our world
I took a picture of the sunrise this morning too. Just north of Austin. It was very pretty today.
I thought it was this week.  Noah was awesome tho!

I think the way we're dealing with issues and able to adapt I think that's just getting better and better
I think the scene with [NAME] kissing in the bathroom after Midge's death is really good. Idk, maybe it's just me.
I think the book portrayal is more ambiguous than you say. I like that the show leans into one interpretation of her character instead of keeping it vague.
I think of fun
I think it would be very tranquil
I think it was a one time thing because they still go for a lot more. I got lucky.
I think it makes me feel mis- sort of happy because it's cool but also sort of
I think it makes me feel excited as its something I would like to do, too
I think it is worth documenting this sort of stuff, as a reminder. They'd do this to your kids too. In a heartbeat.
I think everyone would enjoy it more if you did
I think I would feel very relaxed and cozy
I think I love you mate

I always thought of the sound of lakes freezing on cold nights. It's pretty surreal in itself.
I agree... awesome tune!
I agree with this. I'm extremely happy with the hires, but I think the draft may be a bigger tell tale on how the off-season goes.
I agree that's a good approach to have.
I agree that positive sentences can make our writing clearer. You said it: "Why say something isn't so when you can say it is?" This definitely reminds me of writing in the active voice. Great article; thank you!
I actually like the progression of the [NAME] story. I think he has a chance to have a fantastic arc between FC5 and New Dawn.
I actually have the complete collection so I can play any of them when I want to!

Hope your flight was okay!
Hope your Sunday is going brill

Honestly, it would be even better if she handed the reigns to a brick. Then no deal definitely happens and everyone's happy ever after :D
Honestly, I love hearing about stories like this - like the multitude of Skyrim and Oblivion mod developers who eventually got hired by studios due to their work.
Honestly Texas deserves to win with they way they're playing, they clearly came motivated and they're outperforming UGA on both sides of the ball.
Honestly I don't care if they're faked. It's an original concept that I find pretty funny

Food was beautiful.

[NAME] was speaking as a man./s
[NAME] was nowhere near them, he was by the Falcon.
[NAME] was a [NAME]. He's on your people.
[NAME] took the pupils
[NAME] somehow guides Killie to both 2nd and 3rd place, this frees up an extra relegation spot and Hamilton are finally flushed.

You won't walk away from it with any better understanding of why he was driven to be a composer or made the music he did, but you will have a better grasp on the innumerable details that made Hot Rats a classic.
You shouldn't do nothing to the house.
You should try another way.

You mean, their gender. And no, we really just do as much as cis person.

You mean hormonal differences?
You may lose track of what year you're in
You may have heard that two wrongs don't make a right. That's certainly true of grammar. Applying two negative statements to the same subject is a double negative, almost always a grammatical no-no guaranteed to confuse your readers.
You hit the nail on the head, my friend.
You get to see people in funny situations.
You forgot the /s friend.
You don't play bad guitar btw...
You don't have to say anything.
You do have to take it apart when you're done - unless you're going to have a large ice mountain set up in your game room permanently.
You cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs
You can't see no one in this crowd.
You can't just plug this in the iPad/iPhone and expect it to work. You have to check to make sure it's charging and possibly do some fidgeting with it to get it going.
You can usually simplify sentences like these by replacing the double negative with a positive, all without losing the meaning. Instead of, "The evidence is certainly not irrefutable," you can say, "The evidence is refutable." Remember that "positive" here refers to stating what something is, whereas "negative" refers to stating what something is not.
You can see the influence of other films about the period, notably Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory and Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old.
You can say anything you want
You can be so much more specific when hitchhiking.
You can be highly educated and still incredibly ignorant.
You SW folks and your fancy pubs.
You "couldn't hardly wait" to see more, right?
Yesterday I felt sad and lonely, and then I woke up this morning very happy.

Why would you want to do this?
Why would I do that?
Why stop there
Why say something "is not purple" when we can be more specific and say it is blue? Positive sentences require fewer words, fewer verb conjugations, and draw a direct line to the point you're trying to make. Let's change all the negative sentences above to positive sentences and see how they clear things up.

While you're considering clarity in your writing, consider using the active voice as well. It adds impact to your writing because, in these construct, the subject is carrying out the action of the verb. The opposite of the active voice is the passive voice, where the subject is being acted upon by the verb. In these constructs, the subject is being acted upon by the verb and that can muddy the waters. For more on that, enjoy Change Passive Voice to Active Voice.

When they do channel all-American angst, the tone is winking and wistfully matter-of-fact, rendering adolescent rage as a fun, formal gesture.
When it's the same composer, this kind of thing is bound to happen.
When it is necessary to state that a fact is not true, it can be done by using any negative words, phrases or clauses. Negation refers to these negative words, phrases or clauses.
When it comes to sentences with double negatives, you'll most often find the word "not" (sometimes in a conjunction like don't or can't) or the word "no." Sometimes, a negative can also be formed by attaching a prefix like ir-, in-, non- or un-. Here are some examples in sentences
When did they say the aliens left behind were injured? Or left behind at all?
When Tomlinson addresses a song to "you," it often seems like the same You he and his mates were singing to years ago.

Of course, we can't rid ourselves of negative sentences completely. And we wouldn't want to either. Sometimes it's necessary to say, "This isn't a beetle but I don't know what kind of bug it is." There's no way around saying what "isn't" from time to time. However, in the instances where you can positively say what is rather than what isn't, you're setting yourself up for some nice, clean prose.

Negative sentences can also make use of the words "do" or "will" (including "do," "did," and "does") before "not." In any of these constructs, it's possible to substitute "does not" with the contraction "doesn't." Other examples include didn't, isn't, wasn't, weren't, and won't.
Negative sentences are declarative statements. That is, they relay information believed to be true. Negative sentences are typically formed by adding the word "not" after the helping verb. The most popular helping verbs are a form of "to be," including "am," "is," "are," "was" and "were."
Negative sentence examples include statements of things that are false. They don't have to be accurate or true; they're simply statements from a speaker or writer that are believed to be untrue.

I bought this to extend my WiFi coverage into my garage. My garage is at the upper limit of my home router and I have a weak signal with diminished speed while in my garage. This is important because my cell coverage is very weak and I have to rely on WiFi calling in my area. Unfortunately my home router signal isn't strong enough in the garage for consistent WiFi calling. Hence the reason for purchasing this extender.
I bought this for my daughter as a companion to her Yeti in my Spaghetti game. I wasn't too sure what it was, but I was going to give it a shot. And it was on sale for less than $7, so I though it was a good deal. The game is very interesting, to say the least. You have to assemble the ice mountain and once you do that, it will never go back into the box. EVER! You each have a Yeti and your goal is to get your meatballs on each level of your side of the ice mountain. You slam down on little levers - kind of like hungry hungry hippos - and launch your meatballs. The only problem is that the ice mountain may start to come apart - or even tip! - if you have very strong players.

Double negatives are two negative words used in the same sentence. Using two negatives usually turns the thought or sentence into a positive one. Double negatives are generally discouraged in English because they are considered to be poor grammar and they can be confusing. However, they are sometimes used in everyday casual speech and you'll find many examples in popular song lyrics.

[NAME]? He's an absolute fool. If we need a coach to destroy our organization from top to bottom, he's the man.
[NAME], they've turned into jerks.
[NAME], that uniform. At least the Nazi [NAME] had decent fashion sense. This is a crime against fashion
[NAME], if you're doing an Undertale deal, not having a red heart on your ass is inexcusable.
[NAME], for when you want to be a healer but also want a FUCK EVERYONE AROUND ME button. Although I've been maiming [NAME] recently.
[NAME], don't fucking front the pass if your help defender is [NAME] he will not help you
[NAME], I thought we warned you about trying to collect "data" from this place.
[NAME] will probably get something as worse as [NAME] in ep4
[NAME] will be livid if he does not get a burger but see [NAME] stuffing his face.
[NAME] that bottom picture. the brows mixed with the hair terrify me
[NAME] some of these post i read on this sub its just getting too ridiculous
[NAME] shitting the bed like a 4 year old with diarrhea
[NAME] she wanted this so badly to be a choosingbeggers.
[NAME] might be all those things, but he pissed me off canceling his appearances at Coachella and Gov's Ball. Very unwavy of him
[NAME] isn't even a homer at this point. He's just dumb.
[NAME] is cheaper too. If we would have kept [NAME] we would have had to extend him to over $4mil.
[NAME] is always the dirtiest psychopath
[NAME] is a vile excuse for a human being and a stereotypical, alt-right, [NAME] supporter.
[NAME] is a jinx. Please send him back.
[NAME] is Television. Got it. He's too misogynistic to be the Patti Smith Group.
[NAME] has such a weird relationship with his parents. It's as if he's 15 years old still.
[NAME] hand must have burned holding that blasphemous law book.
[NAME] gets a lot of unfair criticism. [NAME], too
[NAME] feel bad for ye no one can take a joke
[NAME] dude I'm sorry. That's their problem now. Bump some [NAME] and keep moving forward.
[NAME] didn't do all that much with [NAME] and [NAME] and a much better supporting cast either.
[NAME] damn fruit booters.
[NAME] couldn't get them to the playoffs. Pulling out [NAME] for him is dumb
[NAME] believe in evolution and the hat isn't racist just because you say so. Quit trolling.
[NAME] are you me? Like I was relating and then you said rot in Atlanta traffic and the pains of 285 burned into my mind.
[NAME] ain't all that. Sorry.
[NAME] & [NAME]? Also, his ass is as big as her back.
Yup, already blocked his number, he was never supportive
Your wife's behavior is inconsistent with continuing your marriage to her.
Your voice is so fucked up.
Your voice feels so robotic
Your face makes onions cry.
Your face is just fine but we'll have to put a bag over that personality.
Your coaching is terrible.... be ready and see how [NAME] uses [NAME]
Your belief is literally killing children
You've been salty since we beat y'all. That's just how mafia works my friend.
You've become the very thing you swore to destroy
You're wrong. Source: I looked before I commented the first time.
You're still going after this man, you posted from your alt account, give it up and take the L. It's not emasculating at all.
You're so stupid, you threw a rock at the ground and missed.
You're so fat you're the reason why the Earth is tilted.
You're prettier when you don't talk, take a hint.
You're not being used but she has no right to tell you what to do with your money.
You're making yourself look more stupid with every reply. Google what the heck model organisms are.
You're ignorance would be excusable if you weren't so douchey about it.
You're clueless if you think you and even 50 other people would protect you against outsiders without the implied threat of the US military being involved.
You're about as much use as a condom machine in the Vatican.
You're a normie in loner's clothing. If you think that most of us haven't tried all of the above already, you're sorely mistaken.
You're a god damn liar.
You'll have to stay on your toes to follow the plot, which is really not worth the effort.
You talk too loud.
You suck
You still look cranky, goodnight.
You sound like one of google's voices, is that correct ?
You should've smashed his head into it.
You should have noped out of the whole thing the moment the racist with a racist character came into the picture.
You seem to have only participated in this thread to insult me. what a shocker!
You really should not group people with ones you have had bad experiences it will not help you grow
You probably just have a fashion preference, if you arn't dysphoric about it then you don't have another gender really.
You need to have a shower, you smell a bit.
You need to brush your teeth more often.
You need to be more careful with your actions.
You make me want to vomit.
You look like the kind of a person who would take me to a party on the wrong side of town
You look like a failed attempt to gene splice [NAME] and [NAME] DNA
You literally don't know what you're talking about.
You know, you are a classic example of the inverse ratio between the size of the mouth and the size of the brain.
You know things are bad when even John Shuttleworth's Yorkshire tea ads don't help
You know better. People will just ignore this and move on to their next talking point.
You just posted the same thing but made it worse.
You have to leave the house.
You have so many gaps in your teeth, it looks like your tongue is in jail.
You guys are a problem.
You forgot fusion
You don't have very good social skills, do you.
You don't get it, they mean *these* types of immigrants, not *those* types of immigrants
You don't get it, do you? There has already been a 51% attack attempt at BCH and the attackers lost.
You do not look anywhere near 12, you look alot older than 19. To bad i only dated as young as 23 as i would date you
You didn't watch it to the end.
You didn't say they were racist channels
You conveniently forgot nearly killing a toddler by throwing furniture out of a 14 story window.
You come off as very cold and uncaring there.
You choose a bad time, no one is fessing up anything during an election.
You cant love this girl if she already has a GF whom she sounds like she loves. You'll just ruin a relationship
You cannot erase injustice from the world
You can't tell me nothing
You can't just get away with doing that.
You can't argue that these are the same when clearly one of them has a monopoly over the market.
You can only have such preposterously high rates if your tax code contains legal ways to evade taxes (e.g. deducting depreciation on loans).
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it think.
You assumed that I complained about wl charge. Gg. I never said anything that might help you deduce that. Dude just stfu.
You aren't supposed to see your breath in june
You are so ugly, the last time you got a piece of ass was when your hand slipped through the toilet paper.
You are more disappointing than an unsalted pretzel.
You are about one bit short of a byte.
You also gotta be Japanese. If they were into interracial shit with white men that niche would already be filled.
You absolutely should not tell her.
Yet, here we are, a whole sub full of people who seem interested in the stupid things incels say and do...  /s
Yet another clown whining about discussions about bitcoin in a bitcoin sub.
Yet *I* get banned for saying you should downvote posts you don't like. Fml

Yes, and then look hurt when you glare at them for causing a scene and/or not being just as tickled as they are.
Yes you should tell them and report him to the police for dating someone underage and giving her cigarettes.
Yes the ammo health thing really is a chore. Too much realism. we want have some fun in a realistic setting, not a simulator.
Yes the achilles gave out and so did my hopes. I miss brandon :(
Yes that was abuse.
Yes it is child abuse. It's sexist too.
Yes ='(, what a shame, [NAME]
Yep, the presidency isn't at all related to the 22nd amendment. Be gone, chud.
Yep, first hour free at long term. But if you go a SECOND over that you owe them $19.80 ! They're fucking ruthless
Yep, and the worst thing is that the cost of not doing something is invisible, while the cost of doing is not!
Yeeeaaahhh.... "protect"... I'm pretty sure this guy has a rape dungeon filled with schoolgirl body-pillows in his basement.
Yeah, what do you know about her? Her Wikipedia page is pretty barren.
Yeah, clear off. And tell your mates you had a horrible time too.
Yeah, but the sound of a fork against the stainless would be absolutely unbearable.
Yeah, but geology doesn't provide enough pumped hydro. Not enough places to do it.

Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
Yeah they taste so fake!!
Yeah no way random bubbling would get them the highest score. Even in a 50 question test the odd would be ridiculously low
Yeah man, fuck the man. Can't have people getting free stuff or have any creative marketing ideas.
Yeah like "oh yeah? No shit?"
Yeah it's the opponents club that should be scared of us! We are REAL MADRID!
Yeah he's a cunt but that doesn't mean he should be prosecuted for a joke. No matter how bad taste it was.
Yeah but I still don't understand why you said that to her.
Yeah but FGM is basically like cutting off the head of the penis entirely. I'm uncut myself but I get why people do it
Yeah [NAME] is a pretty weird guy.

Wouldn't you rather speak to me than a faceless chatbot?.
Wouldn't you rather speak to me than a faceless chatbot.
Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.
Word salad. You want America to do Afghanistan's job for them. It's not happening, those days are over.
Women have 2 weapons: mascara and tears. Apparently we can't use both at the same time
Woke up on the wrong side of the bed . . sorry i shouted at u  mwa

Who needs sciences. It's most fake news they peddle in anyways...
Who is brainwashing people to believe it's all a social construct ? It's really frightening that it's become so mainstream.
Who fucking cares. People have sex all the time. You're just an asshole for trying to to profit from it or ruin her.
Whittaker, who worked as a research scientist in AI at Google for more than a decade, did speak up, but Google didn't like it.
Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.
Which makes it frustrating to sit through the portions where Holly has to figure it out and convince Ralph and the others to believe her.

Whatever you do, don't give your virginity to anyone. You will regret it if you give it up cheaply.
What...? That's some real mental gymnastics to justify him assaulting her
What's the point of a label compilation.
What's he whining about, I am only 52 and stuck on SSI now and only getting 1400.00
What's frightening about AI isn't terminators and super intelligent machines: it's the way AI works to centralise knowledge and power in the hands of those who already have it and further disempower those who don't.
What we have here is a comedy on life support.
What the hell was that
What the hell kind of university schedules a class at 6am?

Well who knows what valve thinks. I don't like Lyrical and Maut either.
Well that's definitely a pallet headed to walmart. Why am I not surprised
Well that's because you're close-minded. But meh. I don't need your respect. ;)
Well shit, then it's just like [NAME] wouldn't let me complete a maths degree just because I'm ideologically opposed to this 'algebra' thing!
Well she mostly horrible when she was drunk, so drinking less for her would be a huge improvement.
Well it would be a man telling a man with no shame how to dress...
Well if you read my other posts you'd know I did try to end it in a responsible mature way and he refused sooo
Well being told from a young age that us chubby dudes are not allowed to get the girl ever. Thats is why im asking.

Voting for someone to tax you to death makes no sense
Vol. 2 ultimately sags under the weight of its excessive length and uninspired performances from Migos and Lil Yachty,
Very tired. Now I know how tiring it is to earn money
Very sore today. Walking is tough...
Very slow to arrive
Very sad the family home that i spent many happy years in is now up for sale   http://tinyurl.com/ncbmmo
Very sad news for the man. Widespread travel disruption is expected for the evening commute
Very rude customer service. Very average food.
Very fine actors completely wasted in a poorly made reboot.
Very disappointed with my crumpet. Just the one small crumpet cut into quarters for $12.
Very cute, like a reverse hungry hungry hippo, but children can not assemble this themselves. For a game aimed at young children I would like them to be able to play from start to finish independently but the mountain takes forever to assemble, just when you think you've got it all figured out, you press the last piece too hard and have to start over. Not to mention there is a hole in the box where the Yeti is displayed, so the box is useless for storing all the tiny marble sized meatballs. I'd love to see this game remarketed with a fully assembled mountain that doesn't collapse in a larger box that can contain all the parts. Doubt it will get much use at our house unfortunately.
Very  expensive compared to other middle eastern grocery stores in Auckland.
Using my iPhone because I running close to my download limit with half the month left  wishing Optus had better wireless plans
Up at work feeling like crap
Until you provide a valid source nobody cares what your theory is. So it's downvoted.
Until the downvotes roll in and you become glue :(
Unpopular opinion: I'd rather the team signed 26-year-old [NAME] over 30-year-old [NAME] coming off another leg injury.
Unfortunately the rhythmic nature of his play makes him very predictable at high levels. The best Maxi players are rather unmusical, to use the analogy
Ultimately, the biggest issue with The Grudge is that it isn't scary. Or fun. Or remotely interesting.
Ultimately working for Google was incompatible with her role at the AI Now Institute, which she co-founded to examine the social implications of artificial intelligence.

Ughh my tummy feels yucky. Bed time. Miserable boyfriend quickly fixed with a movie with courtney
Ugh....92 degrees tomorrow
Ugh. It is bad when the dog wakes me up b4 the baby does
Ugh. Boys! They seriously suck.
Ugh, the learning curve for hurdles has to be a painful one... kudos for finishing. Last couple falls probably destroyed her knees.
Ugh so tired!
Ugh obviously that's not what I meant, what I meant is that *socially* if they have a sibling that they do not need humans *socially*.
Ugh i'm going to try  *ArTy~BaBy*
Ugh at school right now       i wish it was summer break im so sick of school !!!
Ugh I hate waking up this early in the summer when all the cool kids like @alexalltimelow are still awake
Ugh I feel like crap
Ugh .. Ahh.. I can't sleep
Ugghhh... we deserve better than to resign ourselves to the fact that the best 3B we can get or even strive for is the Cubs third stringer.
Ugghhh! I can't sleep cause i have a headache  And i have summer school tomorrow. Dammit.
Uggghhh it's a Monday morning
Ugggh back to work

Twenty people have been confirmed dead as a result of the fires, and more than an estimated 800 million animals are believed to have died in the blazes.

Trying to install Windows 7 via Parallels via Boot Camp... not going too well at the moment
Trying to fix my poor computer
Trying to finish 2 weeks of school work  since i wasnt in skewll
True, the commonly affiliated ones are mostly just sheer ignorance or things like that.
True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government.
True, but [NAME] mocking someone for making a choice that, realistically, isn't a choice at all is still an oblivious thing to do.
Tried to install the latest VisualWorks using the &quot;Net Installer&quot; ... failed because it doesn't seem to like the proxy at work

To annoy you That's the real on reason
Tired bOred nothing on to watch
Tired and feeling feverish
Tire is fucked so gettin a lift from my dad
Time to cut him off. Or find a way to get him good help. Cause he sounds a little dangerous.
Three year olds learn it's wrong to draw on the walls with crayon. I think you look stupid in this thread.
Thought i was already there with the terrible title.
Thought about that too, guess it's just not the games intention to make the player a part of the things happening in it...
Those words you used. I don't want to believe that exists.
Those refs were terrible, god damn. GG Buckeyes, it was much closer than the score suggests.
Those people are seeking fame and riches, of course they're gonna run into scumbag predators
Those fingers disturb me the most
Those are separate issues from the sample size.
This year marks five years since B.B. King's death,
This workload isn't simply too much for me to handle.
This won't make me happy.
This wok fry pan is NOT non stick! Total waste of money. You can't even make fried rice without it sticking.
This was my second time purchasing this item, as the first iPhone 6s I purchased also had a problem with the camera. I strongly advise against buying a refurbished phone and will never do so again. Basically you are taking a gamble for your money. I thought I was saving money, but I wasted time, energy, and money in the long run. And do NOT buy from MyWit.
This time next week I'll only have 1 exam left
This sucks!! I am sooo awake  I need a surf buddy. Early morning surf might help me sleep.
This sub is a fucking joke now
This qualifies as emotional neglect. Just, to be clear, that is a form of covert abuse and is not okay or normal.
This post should demonstrate that it already has become one of those subs. Disingenuousness is rampant here
This post is bad because the only good phone is the Palm Pre 3 running webOS
This platform is a false.
This must be what you get angry about when you don't have any actual problems in your life.
This movie is just a big bad joke.
This looks like an obvious joke to me. Most of you are getting baited.
This leaves dancers with little protection.
This kid is blatantly trolling and everyone is taking him seriously LMAO. You people should quit Salem your scum reading skills are horrible
This joke has been on here a million times and never ceases to trick me
This isn't very good.
This isn't a beetle but I don't know what kind of bug it is.
This is worse, Balo looks like a horse
This is why I could never work in construction
This is what you get for starring in a mediocre movie
This is the same woman who fought tooth and nail to have wrongful convictions upheld while she was a prosecutor; she craves tyranny.
This is the saddest thing I've seen today
This is the part of moving that sucks... when everything is packed up and I'm sitting in a bare lounge room.  It feels cold and lonely.
This is the most scary [NAME] can ever be to me, cause it's also the most real he could ever be
This is the daily reality for many dancers: They apply vital jolts of energy to music videos, but may still struggle to pay their bills.
This is something kids do on their twitch streams to get subs, pretty sad.
This is so hard to sit through, I can't believe the swearing from this dood, it makes it all the more unbearable
This is rubbish...five general studies papers to be done before lunch.
This is on a video about electric guitars what the fuck?
This is not looking good for China's typical method of say whatever the other side wants to hear then do nothing.
This is me all the time, a mixture of anxiety and dread.
This is incorrect. Taiwan was regarded as an island of no importance.
This is almost irritating. Like, take a breath, shithead..,
This is a slippery slippery slope that ends with the backstory to the Wrath of Khan dude.
This is a customer service gig and you're flipping people off, maybe you should find another line of work
This iconic ruin is beginning to fall victim to its own success
This hurts me more than the fan meme.
This has happened to me with the girls I tried to connect with irl as well as FA "lonely" girls from this very sub
This has been the worst week ever... I just want 2 stay in bed and never get up
This has been largely disproven. [NAME] had no problem dropping the bomb and knew it wouldn't change the outcome of the war.
This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past "was" instead of "had been."
This film never comes close to that level of inspired raunch, losing steam through each of its meager but achingly redundant 83 minutes.
This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
This disaster of a movie shouldn't happen to a dog.
This cut so terribly deep and touched places I had hidden away. I'm at a loss for words.
This comment is way too far down. It should be the top comment.
This cannot be good.
This can not be good.
Thinks Hayley is a clever cat! So tired today! Some one help! I don't want to do any work they all have me spoiled at home and in pros!
They've done it before with private law and private militias, dumbass.
They're saying it was a sick barista
They're products are crap and they don't answer or return calls I am filing a formal complaint
They're probably fighting, that's why she's *really* getting out of the house for "self care."
They're just idiots parking there. No clue that it is a designated bike lane.
They wouldn't be entirely wrong...I know I'm certainly fatigued with the way Doctor Who has been going for a while now.
They wont touch a hero if they tweaked it in last 6-12 months. Like [NAME], they fucked/nerfed her and thats it.
They were talking about what they should call the 'not Constantinople' release in the meeting- its a crime that nobody thought of this.
They were literally traitors to America
They were criticizing your spelling.
They said [NAME] struggled but he made the all rookie team, this guy clearly didn't go very in depth.
They played loud music on a ‘school night', seriously! You're backing the bastards here just to be contrary.
They only want excuses to run the clock down towards no-deal.
They obviously want to make a big stink, and make a big drama.
They never will until it affects them directly, and by then it's already in the end game for us :/
They need more with more items because I've never been able to get same day.
They need all the help they can get. If they continue their bad form they can get relegated. They just fired [NAME]
They have to know how bad people hated it since youtube reset the dislikes on it, from what I understand, more than once.
They got ripped apart here (On Reddit) a few weeks ago for passing false information on aircraft videos and taking legit criticism poorly.
They don't like him, so he is divisive. It's projection.
They don't have one, they just spam and need to be reported.
They didn't even spell his actor's name correctly...
They didn't even respond to my email so I don't think it's gonna work
They can try to do that for as long as they want, doesn't change the fact that 2/3rds of players still chose him over [NAME].
They also don't like him, remember these people have to work with him
These wipes clearly have mold.
These two rivals would torment each other for years to come.
These refs are remarkably terrible tonight. So are the sabres but wow some terrible calls.
These people in here are joking about holding down and cutting their neighbors faces. It's pretty gross.
These are the signs I'm getting old... Wtf is a weed cartridge??
These are all problems you're creating for yourself, not something she's doing.
These are WAY to big as the heel pocket sits behind the ankle.
Theres a BIG difference between being against ones (hateful) political position and between harassing someone for his ethnicity.
There's something about your face that justs irritates me.
There's putting your audience on edge and then there's making a story more trouble to follow than it's ultimately worth.
There's no way this gets signed, right? Is it just lip service?
There's no way around saying what "isn't" from time to time.
There's no PR firm in the world that could change her image, especially when she keeps creating fake accounts and being mean to people.
There's less chance [NAME] will elect a moron dumber than he is.
There's a difference between rights and law. Stop conflating the two.
There should be a NO STARS rating
There must be some awful things happening right at this second
There is three missing Norwegians at the Air France Flight
There is only one metal that should be sliding down their throats. Ka-chunk!
There is little attempt being made to protect native-born people from the negative effects of mass migration. If you think that is morally correct you are insane.
There have been nine arrest warrants executed since a 2014 law change allowed student loan defaulters to be arrested at the border.
There are two different accounts doing this shit atm. Go to r/delusionalartists and sort by new. These guys are being douchebags.
There are some scammers. Support is very weak,
There are other petty crimes that can be more heavily prosecuted, like unpaid child support.
There are no helpful ideas like the one you're looking for. There is only one idea... Tell your parents and get authorities involved.
There are Cubs fans that died at 95 without ever having seen their favorite team win a title. At what point is the LOILTY worth it?
Then they will complain about it being cold in the winter.
Then they are idiots.
Then stop arresting them for shooting at thieves
Then something is very wrong and he needs reworks on the talents
Then let's keep scrolling and posting to push this thread to the bottom - let them waste their time on someone who is absolutely irrelevant at best.
Then it would have been removed. Don't assume my thoughts. I cringed. I posted.
Then I disagree that being a cog in someone's machine is reason to be resentful.
The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage.
The wildfires have devastated 6.3 million hectares, an area of land similar to the size of the entire island of Ireland. It has taken the lives of 28 people, directly impacted 480 million animals, and forced the evacuations of thousands from their homes.
The whole track is anchored by a thick bass groove that allows the rest of the song to peel off into curious and unexpected places filled with crisp guitars, sweet harmonies and swirling synths.
The video, shot at the Bay Dreams festival in Mt Maunganui, shows several people - male and female - scrapping and throwing punches, surrounded by onlookers.
The train smells like BO  this morning
The title is a lie. I dislike what the APA is doing as much as anyone else, but how bout we dont sensationalize it.
The sun doesn't seem to want to shine today... and so am I.
The structure of the show makes it a puzzle to watch
The stressors of the hotel industry are much the same as a restaurant. It doesn't appeal to me
The star couldn't sing no more after the matinee performance.
The song, meant to enhance "Memory" and perhaps improve on it, fails in both cases.
The show with her remains mostly an unpleasant march.
The sheer scale of the devastation is quite overwhelming when you see it firsthand
The series doesn't make room for humor,
The secret and walk away endings are not cannon.
The royal couple stunned the world
The rest you will definitely want to banish to oblivion.
The republicans are the military. You are an idiot.
The remake remains cursed by a fatally hokey concept.
The real problem are all the people on the ground saying the same thing to the guy holding the sign...
The product was only "just okay" from my experience.
The problem with starting off a political discussion like this is that noone's gonna take anything else you say after this seriously.
The problem they have is... They "knew" [NAME] would win.
The package was never delivered. I was charged for the item.
The overall response is try and empower women, abolish prostitution and stop giving lazy men money because they want to live out their idiotic fantasy lives.
The opening number about Jellicle cats, in which the word Jellicle is repeatedly drilled into your ears until you want to cry for mercy.
The only downside is, it is very hard to find the filters and other parts of this vacuum cleaner.
The only complaining was Evan being mortified that we took our modem out in public
The number of pedos is too damn high!
The next step in human evolution is for humanity to end. Life isn't worth preserving.
The mouthbreathers usually aren't boys but guys between 2-3 times my age. Possibly homeless and very smelly.
The majority also think it is too expensive and inconvenient to make
The left solution is to make them all citizens and to buy their votes with welfare and to never lose an election again as they destroy America.
The goods were not sent and the money was not returned
The functions of the site have changed a lot and not for the better.
The fact their team is stacked makes me hate them, along with [NAME] being a dirty player. Also they are in our division
The fact that nobody understands you doesn't make you an artist
The fact someone could read your post and literally go and do this saddens me.
The dryer sounds like a fire hazard to me.
The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.
The doctor says I'm OK, but I feel like I've dyed a little inside.
The day you were born was a sad day for the world.
The day sucks... got the monday morning blues which have extended to the afternoon
The day could not have gotten worse
The cruel reality for dancers is that their work does not change whether the video is union or non-union,
The country registered 10 journalist killed last year.
The constant pressure definitely isn't helping. I'm already on anti-depressants, but I am terrified of PPD.
The computer is dirty.
The comments under that video are disturbing. People actually see this as a sign of the end of times.
The comments on this thread are what I expected and that makes me sad.
The city is struggling to cope
The cheap scares and lethargic script will leave its audience bored to death.
The case garnered national media attention, with many painting Carter as a manipulative and cunning sociopath intent on harming others to gain a sense of control.
The bourgeoisie elected courts were going to backtrack on all [NAME] economic reforms. Fuck those guys.
The best way is killing people that don't know you. Also you could steal some things so the cops think that it was a robbery
The battle escalated uncertainty and caused businesses to pull back
The anniversary march was held in Derry Sunday past , not one mention on BBC itv not a thing. 14 people murdered in cold blood. Nothing.
The adults are a bit drunk and I just got called an anti social bastard Pray 4 me
The absolute subhuman filth that worships [NAME] will believe that this isn't even a photoshop
The Outsider will leave you with similar impatience for the indecipherable.
The ID cards wouldn't have been a problem if they were like the EU one. It was the fuckload of biometric data that was abhorrent.
The EPA website has been struggling to cope with traffic this morning and has crashed several times
The Democrats do not want to give [NAME] any victory at all that is a simple reason why they oppose the wall now.
The "[NAME] says it's true" line makes me think he's messing with you.
Thats a red flag that you're a big part of his son's life after 5 months. This all seems very immature, both you and him.
That's...not at all what I said. I said I *hoped* they would tell me. [NAME].
That's way dangerous to keep then together they may break out and start feedig on the other ear buds to gain heir strength
That's such a lame excuse.
That's really sad. I used to live not far from there and spent a lot of time in that park. Fished in those ponds many times.
That's really creepy. What is crazy is that 9 year old's get cell phones now! Times have certainly changed :p.
That's quite a lot worse tbh
That's not very cash money of you
That's not true at all. I play on xbox and you can't Loot teammates you or any squad mates kill.
That's not the first time I've heard it said that a GA acted assholic, not apostolic in real life.
That's less functional and more cleanup though...
That's kinda a cruel thing to say cause she's your best friend?
That's ignorant as all hell. Tell them to buy their own.
That's got nothing to do with anything that's happened in this thread
That's gonna be a no from me, dawg.
That's always what I thought as well, but isn't that essentially being transphobic, etc?
That's all [NAME] had to do with his egg, instead he decided to bathe with it to make things weird
That's absurd, people commit crimes blacked out on drugs/alcohol all the time. Also, they could just claim they don't remember it either way.
That's a rather annoying extrapolation of what I said.
That's a bummer.
That's a bit violent...... But then again I'm a [NAME] so whatever
That would set an awful precedent Anytime the president can't pass something legislatively, he can just shut down the government to force his agenda through.
That would be really rough. However she is so incompetent I wouldn't be surprised if she self immolates
That won't do you no good.
That was your saddest shortest story yet
That was the worst power play I've ever seen
That was the dumbest movie I've probably ever scene.
That was a fluid motion and it scared me
That seems pretty rough. If I ask Google for directions from white center to Fiona it's only an hour by bicycle even.
That outfit can't simply do for such a formal affair.
That makes dancers even more vulnerable to pay cuts because independent contractors are not covered by minimum wage rules.
That logic doesn't work. Porn stars make movies knowing they are going to be seen, but it is still objectification.
That knife looks awfully familiar... *snorting and claw clicking in the distance*
That is patently false, considering his history of driving multiple businesses into the ground.
That is by far too strong of a passive
That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
That is always a black box to fans too - let's say they pull the trigger, we have no idea if any of these reports are real
That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.
That damn FDR who America loved so much they had to write an amendment to the Constitution to keep anyone else from being elected that many times
That can't be good.
That book would be the biggest flop, the characters and plot are really too outrageous to be believable.
That band sucks why do you even like them.
That attitude won't get you nowhere.
Thank fuck. So if you play exclusively through Steam is any action needed?
Texas, I'm really just mad at myself for not double checking. But now I have a year to find something better
Terrible dialogue, unbelievably predictable plots, not an ounce of originality
Taking the 4 year old to the doctor this morning. She says her stomach still hurts and is totally lethargic.  I'm worried.
Take this down my dude. This is cruel.
THE IMAGE ASKS "WOULD YOU VIOLENCE THIS BABY IF BABY WORE HAT" THE ANSWER IS "NEH"
Suspicious
Sure. The subject of her video was certainly creepy and obnoxious.
Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.
Super fake news. This wasn't brought up when directly asked about it in previous testimony.
Super creepy. And leaving the note is out of line
Sunday Sale. FAIL. How embarrassing
Suddenly in an awful mood Maybe I should delete her so I dont have to hear about how happy they are...At least now I have him
Such ingrained prejudices cannot be corrected easily
Stupid postman needs to hurry up with LVATT
Stupid [NAME] is playing into the Church's hands. What an idiot. He has an amphetamine addiction.
Student unions have criticised the border arrest policy as draconian and likely to make overseas Kiwis student-loan refugees.
Stuck in traffic
String cheese gave me the shits
Stop thinking about yourself. Go help someone and work hard at being useful. There's no satisfaction or fulfillment in self-obsession. Get over yourself.
Stop spraying chemicals daily in the sky.
Stop being such a condescending prick.
Stoopid college  Still can't get through on the phone
Stokes claims his signature was allegedly forged on several documents that moved his copyrights and attendant rights over to the former Music Publishing Company of America.
Still, the family found the move stressful, in large part because of the volume of paperwork the immigration process required.
Still in the office. No way I'll be getting up to #SMCSYD
Still feeling really unwell
Still feeling down in the dumps today
Still can't shake the sickness bug

Stepped on Stubb in the dark then almost broke his leg off  But he is okay and asleep on my bed
Staff and visitors were absolutely devastated to find the pounamu had been taken
Spent weekend being plagued by Hayfever. My sides actually ache from coughing and sneezing. No outside lunches for me
Spelling fail on my last tweet. Dentist this morning for standard check up...will cost millions of £££s no doubt
Speech should be illegal if it is an incitement to violence or a call to commit crime. Everything else, however repulsive it might be, must be legal
Sped
Sounds like you want to control what tthey do with their nukes! Who cares if they leave it laying around and let their children play with it
Sorry, yes they do. [NAME] is the worst QB mentioned in that list.
Sorry, no. We're just going to export [NAME] to you guys.
Sorry, could you please try putting that in a longer sentence?
Sorry, but this is a disappointment in 2019.
Sorry thought you were the other guy that said it was a privilege.
Sorry pal, it's actually one of my least favorites :/
Sorry man I don't really like duck.
Sorry but this looks like from a Tumblr fetish fanfiction site. I don't think it belongs here.
Sore throat. The kind where you have to eat or it's sore. It's so annoying!
Sore legs  suck
Sometimes I wish you would just leave.
Sometimes I think it's like the movie *Shallow Hal*. You see the person for who they really are on the inside, and it's terrifying.
Something something broken arms
Something is eating this poor redditor and I don't think it's the injustice of society at large to accept face tattoos.
Someone will actually spend their money on this too, that's the sad part
Someone save me from learning about church history..  it's beyond boring..
Some staff have had the grim task of removing bodies of wildlife, including kangaroos, who died in the devastating fires
Some of the threads were machined poorly. I couldn't screw in a few of the angled elements all the way.
Some of the bills were more than my monthly salary, but it was the mountains of paperwork that was the worst part.
Some judges are just literally scum. Have those in Germany aswell. Unfortunately.
Some had seriously hoped Sergey and Larry would step in and fix Google. Instead of righting the sinking ship, they jumped ship
Some goods delivery taking too long.
Some do. Some don't. Blanket generalizations are almost always false and unhelpful.
Some days you have to wonder why you bother trying to help people
Social media has also become a breeding ground for bullying, hate speech and cancel culture
So you defend an evil murdering dictator and pedal conspiracy theories and whataboutism. Grow up.
So wrong. Most every denomination believes they are the only ones who are doing it right and everyone else is going to rot in hell.
So what I'm hearing is your dad didn't do a good job ~~brainwashing~~ raising you :-P
So tired... I do not want to go to work.
So tired!  I wish I could go home! Ahhh x
So tired and boring..
So tired after my leave. Don't want to go back to work
So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.
So sad to see @livin4urkisses and @kristenwacholz go!!!
So not lookin' forward to tmrw
So i don't have a pet snake anymore  stupid boys.
So gutted
So deport the bad guys and let the asylum seekers come in. Sounds like we don't need a wall anyway.
So bored  talk to me.
So [NAME] proved that they are not literally selling their workers into sex slavery. That's a pretty low bar!!
So You're going to become India... Because immigrants... Dude... If you got nothing just say so.
So I lied... I'm actually still awake. No sleep  hmmm btw funny how the only thing I ate yesterday was a hotpocket and 9 twizzlers.
Snore
Sneaky ass ESPN changing their app so I almost accidentally purchase ESPN+ for the low price of 4.99 a month.
Slept on my side last night and now my left ear is back to normal but my right ear is worse! My balance is wayyy off now
Skeptical
Size chart is not the same on the product as it is in the listing.
Sir, you have been warned. You antagonistic attitude will not be tolerated. Please try harder at being a model citizen. Thank you for your cooperation.
Sick with a sinus infection
Sick for 6 days now..
Sick as a dog...   Never really understood that phrase... does it mean I'm going to go out into the garden and eat some grass?
Si did you decide to change the company policy at the next board meeting or didn't you, you can't just leave us hanging like that!
Shut up you tool.
Should have been a and 1 tbh, [NAME] smacked him in the face.
Shoot
Shock collars are horrible. They poor pup.
She's ugly so that might add some more months.
She's just going to suck you back in.
She's an apathetic person
She's a palace-wrecker
She was terrified
She spent a night in jail,
She should be FIRED
She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
She missed the part where that's her problem.
She might be a [NAME] but she ain't my Waifu ARTEMIS FOREVER SUCKERS
She is still a billionaire. I guess stupid Tweets are going to bankrupt her?
She is an asshat for driving on the walkway but fuck these guys. They should probably find something better to do with their lives.
She immediately regretted it when you reacted like an excited 3rd grader
She got more votes tho... If popular vote determined the winner, you wouldn't say this. You sound like you just hate [NAME] for... reasons?
She does not speak Spanish.
She did not like Bikhram yoga.
She cannot comprehend the extent of the disaster.
She always looks sticky.
Several outdoor suburban swimming pools have also closed this morning due to the smoky conditions
Seriously. "Haha british people pronounce something funny" "Yeah well your children are murdered in violent attacks and your healthcare system puts millions in crippling debt"
Seriously, check his food. It is upsetting his stomach.
Selfish
Self-selecting user ratings are not a reliable representation of the entire audience. They are meaningless numbers.
See, this is what films lack nowadays, taking real risks with implications of [NAME] on Animal fart sex. Bravo [NAME]!
See this is why they should merge r/forhonor and r/forhonormemes cause clearly it makes no difference what subreddit it's on
School Board Trustees are leeches of the system in any district. It's the most unnecessary position that does nothing more than continuous damage.
Scenes frequently play out in conditions close to pitch-blackness, making many story beats difficult to follow.
Scary that [NAME] ASG effort looked similar to some of his regular season performances.
Says the guy not replying to any counter points lmao
Saw the police and they use an invisible boatcar to get this one is my first heartbreak.
Sat at home bored stiff
Sandra Cantu is found dead in a suitcase  Missing children stories never seem to go good. Poor family.
Same. All other map on OG with SSD were fine. [NAME] drops and it's terrible.
Same my dance card is completely full. I'm looking at a big pile of snow, I couldn't possibly fit that in.
Sam has never been there.
Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
Sadly I had to scroll through the story to read this
Sad
SWTOR is horrible when you want to play together with someone. So many parts that you can't join in on.
STILL no news. Sorry guys
SOS! Stuck in a sickeningly boring meeting for planning on a supremely boring event
Rush rush rush college today  I don't wanna go back
Run the addresses through the property records. If the mailing address of owner ain't local, they its a lie.
Rude
Roy used a gasoline-powered water pump to fill his car with carbon monoxide,
Rodney is retiring and I am sad
Rock is not sure about it.
Rick is not here.
Richard is buying unnecessary things.
Rheged sounds like a racist name for a [NAME]. Don't think it will catch on tbh
Revising 4 final exams. ugh
Returning this as from out of the box the jar started to leak, after inspection I believe the bottom blade compartment is removable, which is easy to clean at the same time its another breaking point when you lock the jar to the motor there are 3 joins Jar, blade and motor, which lead to the leak.
Restaurants and bars are also struggling to look after their regular customers
Recent Russian behavior is unacceptable...no doubt about it.
Really? I could've sworn I've seen people disabling comments on certain posts before..
Really thirsty..  Going to grab something cold..... Monday blues already making me drenched with sweat!

Really don't want to leave today
Random people following me is kinda creepy
Rain does not make nice going out weather
RIP Sandra....its so sad    how can someone do something like that??
Quit being a crybaby. If this how you handle any criticism then it's no wonder you're alone and will be for quite some time
Quit
Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.
Public radio streaming APP down for the 2nd day. So sad!
Ps I miss you @radioashley really bad.
Probably not making good pass decisions.
Probably because they are trying to talk about the issues that "corporate dems" tend to ignore.
Pretty terrifying. Imagine if you went on a school trip, did nothing, and came home to this.
Pretty sure it's a rubber toy made to look like one
Pretty big signs that something can be pretty fun and effective when you get these same shitty, selfish teammates.
Presidents using these robots will loose all legetimacy. They will become dictators. People should invest in good cameras to document the events and share it everywhere.
Pres named his business barstool. The expectation of stupidity is the brand.
Possibly. He spent time in the crypts, but he was told in no uncertain terms that, as a bastard, he didn't belong there.
Poor lady. I wish I could help.
Poor crack baby
Poor [NAME]. One of the great men of our time getting destroyed by the courts. I hear he has to file for bankruptcy.
Poor Joshy is sick???   those damn tejanos!
Police told Newshub three people were taken into custody during the popular festival - two were warned for disorderly behaviour and a third - a 30-year-old man - charged with possession of party drug ecstasy.
Police numbers in London are at their lowest (per head of population) in twenty years. Those fucking cuts!
Plot twist: the customer just found she's diabetic and that's why she's crying.
Plot itself is pretty predictable
Please feel free to laugh at me if I am wrong but I have seen this movie before...this game is over.
Please don't think the way they're trolling represents us [NAME]. I'm sorry this happened.
Please don't promote your channel
Please don't murder me
Please don't marry this man-child.
Please don't come back.
Played
Play something else and come back later. You're burning yourself out
Plaster ingested can obviously be very toxic. After Lily's accident [another cat she owns], I should have got pet insurance!! My little lion man is okay but it has been very scary.
Place is dodgy and  racist AF!
Phone didn't come in the original box as they advertised. That's ok I can live with but the main problem was the mic and speakers won't work when I place a call. I tried few tricks suggested out there on the internet but still it didn't work.
Pffft right, next you'll tell me America isn't a representative democracy, or that England isn't a monarchy! Don't be a fool!
Peter has no books.
People would still always parry them (600ms) :(
People are less willing, I think, to make an effort to action those opinions
Peak hour traffic sucks even more with a headache.
Patrick has no knowledge about it.
Pathetic performance by Team India
Pasta left to your door today is 4 years as outdated! Be aware. Some quality grammar there...

Our lids were very difficult to get on and the lid leaked in the seal with lid firmly on. We returned them
Ouch  I feel for you girl.
Ooooh that was a missed opportunity
Ooo, I wouldn't go that far.

Only a dozen times? That's nothing. You can do that in one evening. You're giving up before you even tried!
Online gaming is toxic. If those cuts were ever tapped, there would be lots of people in jail.

One of the more disgusting virtue signals I've seen
One of Europe's great destinations is also overrun with tourists
One hour of study left for today... ahhh getting so tired and sore from it
One dancer who spoke on condition of anonymity describes the lack of negotiating power.
Once upon a time I got banned for a whole day because of bad behavior... Oh wait that was all of us...
On-court obnoxiousness should be punished and has nothing to do with the game of playing tennis. Bring your A game hitting the ball or walk off the field.
On the way to work unfortunately... This is gona be a long day
On my way to the hospital this morning to have my right leg checked......thinking it might be broken
On a related note, why does it shatter? I expected it to break into a few large pieces, rather than completely fall apart.
On [NAME], the allegations and the final result were very different. If I recall most of the complaints substance was rejected or disproven.
Omg [NAME] he's there because you don't listen. You ass!
Okay I'll call them tonight and cry on your behalf.
Ok until you have a problem
Ok this whole waking up before 10 thing really hass to stop....
Ok that was a rude way to send him off. Can I have hot doctors again
Ok so this doesn't seem like a cover given they made a whole comp for him
Ok but how is that a jerk he's not pushing anyone off their chair
Oh, it's only made them more determined to invent the "creepy [NAME]" narrative themselves.
Oh, give me a break, it was worded like an insult, clear as a day. A mild one, but still.
Oh! you think I am joking, you are so fucking dumb
Oh she dead
Oh no, I hate when my technology breaks down.
Oh no! The ugly ugly ugly shirt design has already been submitted for printing! Mine won't be accepted
Oh no! I'll check into it; there are transcripts available, but it isn't really the same thing, is it?
Oh no! I don't want anyone eliminated from Masterchef!
Oh my goodness! Poor Charlie.
Oh my [NAME], this is an absolute lie.
Oh man I was being facetious It annoyed me so much
Oh great so now i need a tv license or to watch in potato. This is piss poor.
Oh for fuck sake. Things were going so well on the coaching front. This dude is nothing but a suck up
Oh damn, it's gonna hunt me down.
Oh come on, you can't mention Psi-Ops without linking the theme song!
Oh come on, can you just enjoy the damn picture?
Oh come on! Stop posting this stuff. FFS will you think of my blood pressure!? You're killing me (figuratively speaking).
Oh boy do I have some bad news for you!
Oh back to work again!!!!! Oh how I hate mondays!!!!!

OMG... going home soon... brain not working. Head Spinning. and worst part is I'm having a big family dinner. Goin home to help up my mum
Now to figure out what to eat. I hate figuring out food when I'm by myself. Eating alone sucks and I've got a week of it
Now this is poke choking!
Now im not even sure if my ride is coming. Ugh! Mondays
Now I wanna know how the hell did you stole the body of an NPC :o
Now I feel like an idiot calling it a beamer for the 15 years I played baseball.
Nothing to eat
Nothing ocular about that smackdown. Raunchy just peaked all over [deleted].
Not true. Our knowledge of it is derived from the fossil record, which is geological.
Not true for a lot of people but [NAME]
Not to mention the fact, that he's casually smoking a cigarette 3 inches away from an infant.
Not to mention that half the women out there are immediately disqualified (at least in my book) by having kids.
Not to be the joke of the entire league
Not to assume things here but why would you gas yourself over [NAME], kid is a fucking monster
Not shocked by the subs [NAME] is active in...
Not really. They redefine the NAP and ownership until the people they don't like are now the bad guys just for trying to exist.
Not really. Everyone has different thoughts about kids and I don't see it as appeasement.
Not really, the save file has nothing to do with the engine.
Not really, in my mind it was continuous cringe that I was always curious about
Not practicing with the team, seems like a bad sign for playing today.
Not only that, the "improved controls" aren't a thing at all. I'm not re-buying Blood Money for nicer graphics.
Not only has the accident left Charlie out of sorts, but it has taken a toll on her other cat Lily - which no longer recognises Charlie after his close shave.
Not many people have asked if I'm OK, but it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.
Not looking forward to maths exam 2day
Not looking forward to another week of work. I need a holiday
Not lookin forward to go to work
Not good idea, unless you mean "money" as gold. She would ruin it with inflation.
Not feeling well again tonight going to bed early. Glad I didn't have to work tonight but shitty I work tomarrow
Not feeling good...  goodnight!
Not as happy as I had hoped to be.
Not allowed to leave appt coz missing luggage due to be delivered. Sewerage works under way just outside so can't open windows
Not against us this season, apparently.
Not (Certified Refurbished) as claimed. Nothing more then broken phones of some sort that are cleaned to look good and sold.That's not (Certified Refurbished). Touchscreen keyboard had many letters that didn't work. Clearly the digitizer is bad. Something a real Refurbished phone would have been checked for and replaced before being sold. Out of the box it was clear there were screen issues
Nope. I'd rather they fix their servers instead.
Nope. I don't think so either. Same thing I noticed with a couple of accounts that posted here at ESS recently.
Nope. A mamzer is someone who was born from an adulterous affair between two [NAME]. You're 100% [NAME] though!

No. These are the people who loved someone with BPD, but got used/abused/abandoned by them. It's mostly romantic relationships. Family tends to be on r/raisedbyborderlines.

No, they couldn't hav- They shouldn't have. uh...this makes me feel sick

No, it's because of the misogyny that's often present in the community.
No, he's dead.
No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap.
No, but I might choose to not support certain teams because their owners are trash.
No way!!! I have another puncture in my double buggy! Not happy about this big phil and ted fail
No that would be yet another mistake.
No thanks, he's already been flushed

My problem with your problem is I don't understand what the heck you're talking about.
My point was that there is no good vote here. This is legislative battle over wall funding and any given vote makes sense only in that context.
My point is that they give him shit for legitimate reasons.
My point is that [NAME] is a giant hypocrite for claiming he wants to respect party democracy while ignoring members.
My parents just couldn't understand that pick

Mine used to tell „you complain too much". I was also angry when I was with him. I‘m not like that.
Mine is 2.5 and trying to drop her last nap. She needs it so desperately though. It is HELLLLLL dealing with this.

Meh... Almost Lover is the exception... this track gets me depressed every time.
Me too. I have so much shit and I can't imagine taking any of it into my car and piling it that high. Wtf?
Maybe it's similar to how [NAME] hates cantaloupe.
Maybe it's as dangerous for [NAME] to whip people up talking about treason and betrayal and all that as it is when [NAME] do it. Fancy that.
Maybe I'm crazy but to me it looks like she's just giving a "thank you" nod
Materialistic people just need to get a life.

Man. I can't wait until my life is so devoid of meaning I feel compelled to complain in a silly joke subreddit.
Man, I remember when we were utter pish. Those were not happy memories.
Man this sub has become so elitist and snooty.
Man it was that long since the [NAME] days? Damn time flies

Major stomach ache.
MACYS CRYINGGGG. OMG. im sad now
Lousy service.Had to wait nearly an hour and got nothing.We had to leave the place and find somewhere else to go for Mother's day.

Lost my kid to the system, wanna see wha the wee lassie has tae say
Looks like you got it bad. How soon till you can get out on your own?
Looks extra creepy in light of the recent revelations about his campaign.
Look no one cares about your opinion.
Look at that piece of shit covering his badge number. I hope he loses his job over this. What a lowlife piece of shit.
Long, drawn out, generic drama
Little scrub didn't even make it through the first week of NN19.

Let the sheer grinding monotony of Cats stand as a measuring stick for future cinematic takes on Broadway musicals that hope to match its unparalleled, bottom-feeding dreadfulness.

Kratz and insertion in the same sentence makes me nauseous for some reason..

I´m sitting at school !! its so boring !
Ive seen that move no less than 5 times and I still get irrationally angry at the Harvard rich kid
Its the saddest thing when you spend weeks creating something only to watch how much it fails
Its raining soooo hard!! So sick of this rain!   ughh
Its often not like they can fight back or, hell, remember the treatment to give them bad rep later on
Its natural to fear what is unknown. Especially when someone is trying to force you to open a sketchy box while probably grinning the whole time.
Its kinda odd,how theres always kinda a war between "Party music" and "Feelings Music"
Its first residents were black and mixed-race people forcibly moved from central parts of the city and, lacking amenities and links to the city, gangs recruiting unemployed youths quickly became a problem.
Its cold and wet and I'm waiting outside for this girl to come to start work
Its a weird thing they do south of the border... they throw flour at each other. No idea why that's a thing.

It's weird to think of a functioning email account that's existed at the same time as the Twin Towers
It's the number one reason I refuse to exercise.
It's so focused on the presenter and he is so unengaging it's painful.
It's showing up on mobile aswell, the double slash is weird for me though, probably on his end
It's raining  and doesn't look like it will stop
It's probably down to low player base.
It's not vague at all. No one aside from slave owners thinks anyone has a rightful claim to another persons life.
It's not the same as it used to be
It's not satisfying at all. If this wasn't [NAME] it wouldn't be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.
It's not conceited at all. We artists put fragments of ourselves into our work, either intentionally or otherwise. You have every right to be upset.
It's like muricans don't want to protect their own jobs and are happy to become low-wage dump and burn workers for the owning class.
It's just sad, with what's going on with the bushfires
It's funny when a whole sub rejects any new information which doesn't fit their narrative.
It's even worse when you get someone from NJ who has no clue how to drive in the city environment.
It's even more useless if there is no other source of power (capacitor, etc.) other than the sun to work.
It's big risk to shop I lost $110

It's bad enough when the Jocasta syndrome is one-sided. This is a pile of yikes.
It's annoying. You always gotta give the other guy a chance. That's how MMA works
It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.
It's also had derogatory meaning for nearly 400 years. people with any common sense or taste will generally choose *any* other word.
It's alright. This is just an unpleasant memory now. Kind of rude of your brother though!
It's almost a touch too big and I can feel the phone sliding around at times.
It's actually somewhat maddening to me that there are people who watch his video and actually think he is doing a public service. Yikes..
It's a weird way of saying you don't want to see my penis
It's a shame he didn't trust you enough to believe you, but instead believed his own assessment of what he was worth.
It's a sad day
It's a nightmare.
It's a foreign disaster for New Zealanders, because although there have been wildfires, none have been on this scale.
It's a bit quiet in here
It' kinda ironic that "Winners" are actually losers (they haven't realised that yet)
It would be good if the producers can find a carrot to dangle that can get these idiots to spill on each other.
It was terrible.  I waited over 1 hour for a sandwich, chips and salad.
It was pretty mediocre.
It was pretty heart breaking, then the council came out and said they weren't going to collect them. Made a lot of people mad.
It was only out for like 2 weeks or something  But its coming to dvd at the end of the month.
It was on a washed out road in the at 2am. Which makes it even worse. They never should have been towing that vic.
It took tons of time, and it was far more expensive than I anticipated

It pains me to see [NAME] used in this abhorrent meme
It makes me feel sad for whoever owned that house that they've just had their property destroyed

I paid full price for a new device and was delivered a scuffed used headset and controllers.
I own oculos go and oculos quest, this is by far very clunky and not user friendly, do not waste your money on this complicated vr headset, you'll end up wasting a lot of time to have it not work, I spent a good part of a day trying to bind and it just doesn't work, look elsewhere, I'll be returning this thing asap, go with oculos go for a more polished product
I noticed that too! Lol it's bugging me.

I doubt it, serial killers enjoy killing, the stuff they do afterwards is just the icing on the cake for them.
I doubt I will be able to update my videos today. Screw it. I'm taking the day off.

I don't understand how her hair is 'too light' or how that effects the concealer.

I don't even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
I don't date women who smoke. As for pills or syringes etc, I don't find recreational drug users attractive. Similarly for being drunk.
I don't belong to no one
I do. Am chemist. Stop serving me things that remind me of work, goddamit.
I do remember this and wanted nothing more than to kill that guy
I do not want to tell them that the world saw the smoke and did nothing to put out the fire.
I disagree with all of what you just said but I am in the same booooaaaaat.
I didn't think it'd be quite this bad
I didn't sign up for this shitfest

I didn't get to see anything on the way here.
I didn't get that
I couldn't make it.
I could still lie in bed
I could see that nobody wants to be called ignorant. I also learned about the fallacy from [NAME].
I could be completely crazy but didnt they attempt a coup like 2 years ago and it failed?
I collapsed yesterday  Im really worried about my health... Something strange is happening.
I changed  my password and Tweetdeck is not accepting it

I am SO GLAD that that shit didn't exist when I was a teen!  Imagine the permanent record of stupid decisions!!

I also feel a little bit of anger
I also feel a bit scared
I almost jumped over a fire. Someone kicked it before I could.  Jenny lost her shoe.

However, they were met with the response: "that's so boring, I don't want to go".
However, they rarely take these topics too far past surface level brushes, resulting in a lot of talking sad and saying nothing.
However, her own early experience with social media was not positive.
How would you get off? HOW WOULD YOU GET OFF?!?!
How the hell is that comment "holding the GM accountable"

How about dumb trolls like you who only repeat your own stupid narratives and word-bending 24 hours a day
Honestly, that would be my nightmare, I'd rather keep [NAME] another season and draft a new QB in 2020 instead
Honestly, no. But even vague references would do more to help decide if it's a fresh take on something.
Honestly this type of support sounds very shallow. It's not like you're gonna support women in any way when their babies are born.
Honestly at this point they need to do that or adjust [NAME] 3d model. The command grabs literally go thru opponents constantly, it looks weird as hell
Holy sh**t i have the worst headache right now!
Hold the fuck up.
Hold still I'm trying to imagine you with personality.

Heading to the airport for my flight back to Houston. Sad times
Headache!!
Headache
He's not an ugly guy, but 8 is too high. He's between 5-6.
He's not THAT bad on YouTube, but on Twitter... Let's just say that he's problematic
He's most likely been misinformed
He's a way worse version of [NAME]. I don't think anyone is putting him in their top 15 besides Bears fans.
He won't stop shaking. Won't lay down. Ugh
He was in the merge lane and should have yielded. He was legally in the wrong.
He wanted to make a fake foul.he didn't know it was nacho
He took it too far
He still has less health than [NAME] despite being slower and bigger and literally revolving around trading.
He ruined himself. Period. You owe him nothing.
He mustn't know about Mr. [NAME] and the cause of his untimely death.
He keeps saying this in my playthrough when that's definitely NOT what I'm doing. I just suck at hunting!!
He isn't unique to that. Every defensive metric disagrees
He hates the Falcon because his dad would leave him all the time on it as a kid
He has a special car because he cannot walk.
He gave his 20 year old ex herpies dumped her and she killed herself. He's an awful person
He doesn't seem like he has all the facts straight
He disagrees with Trump's hard line views on immigration, arms control and climate change
He described the crash as a "tragedy that not only shocked Canada, but the rest of the world".
He also says something about waking up from a nap in his gameplay reveal calling it a "pain in my ass"
He also needs to understand it's insanely hard to empathize with multimillionaires playing a kids game asking for hundreds million more.
Have you lost the sense of direction, I am here look here, you dumb thing
Hate men who sit directly in front of you with legs wide open. Like they're showing off their masculinity to you or something

Hard pass on this!
Hanging in Crooners. Wanna sing. Can't. Sucks.
Haha and [NAME] is calling the Chicago crew the most triggered bunch. Then proceeds to scream at them like the little triggered bitch he is.
Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times.
Ha me too. I'm afraid we've been called out

Furthermore, members of Australia's Parliament are refusing to acknowledge the role climate change has played in drying the bush and triggering prolonged droughts, all of which provided the perfect storm for this catastrophe.

Every time I see someone walking around with their toddler now all I can think is *poor basrard, he has no idea what's coming*.
Even worse: "Share something interesting about yourself." Suddenly I become the most boring person ever to exist.
Even on steroids of all kinds in high doses there is no way that this is done in 16 weeks
